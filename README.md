# Low Frequency Trader

Fully automated algorithmic trading platform, written in C++ and designed from the ground up to be `constepxr`, thereby offering compile-time unit testing and memory allocation guarantees.

## Project status

This is a total redesign of the original [LFT project](https://github.com/deanturpin/lft), which will continue to run in the background whilst this second revision is being developed.

### To be done

- [ ] Compile time strategy implementation
- [ ] Alpaca exchange integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions pipeline (rather than VPS)
